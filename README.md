## A fun throwback to a Mod1 project from my time at Turing!

## What is it:
Great practice for using classes, localstorage, array prototype methods, error handling, creating a timer, and more.  Users can select an activity and a specific time, and the page will countdown a timer to completion.  Users can then log the activity and view it on the side.  

Details...
The details of this project are outlined in the [Project Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/intention-timer-group.html)
